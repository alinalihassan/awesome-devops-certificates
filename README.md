# Awesome Certificates
A curated list of certifications and links to more information about them, as well as some other providers with tens or hundreds of certifications each. Please note that while certifications for Programming Languages aren't used in the industry, and thus the list is intentionally kept short for the ones that might receive some credit, in other domains like Cloud and Cybersecurity, certificates are widely used to asses skill level.
